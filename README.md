Final Project: 
Gathered demographic and water resource information to explain patterns spatially and statistically in the distribution of degraded rivers within Texas.

1. GIS_Programming_pandas.py - data preparation in Python using the pandas library.
2. GIS_Programming_pop_county.py - simple select script used to filter counties used for my analysis.
3. GIS_Programming_paper_11.16.pdf - PDF paper describing my data understanding, preparation, analysis/modeling, and evaluation of spatial and statistical distribution of 
  degraded streams in Texas as compared to demographic variables. Used OLS models.
