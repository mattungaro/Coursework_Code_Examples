## I. GIS Programming

Final Project: 
Gathered demographic and water resource information to explain patterns spatially and statistically in the distribution of degraded rivers within Texas.

1. GIS_Programming_pandas.py - data preparation in Python using the pandas library.
2. GIS_Programming_paper_11.16.pdf - PDF paper describing my data understanding, preparation, analysis/modeling, and evaluation of spatial and statistical distribution of 
  degraded streams in Texas as compared to demographic variables. Used OLS models.

## II. Advanced Remote Sensing 
Studied the effects of restored and natural wetlands on surface temperature using remotely sensed Landsat imagery, finding that both types in Florida tended to reduce surface temperature at the same general rate.

1. Advanced Remote Sensing Final Project.r - analysis of data gathered from remote sensing work in ENVI and QGIS. 

# II. Advanced GIS
Gathered demographic and water resource information to explain patterns spatially and statistically in the distribution of degraded and restored rivers within North Carolina census block groups.

1-5. Series of simple Python scripts (buffered_everything, clipped_impaired_and_unimpaired, greater_than_5000, impaired_and_unimpaired, KML_to_layer) used in data understanding, preparation, and processing.
